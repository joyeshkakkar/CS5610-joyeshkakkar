    This week, I have worked on the project.I have researched on the spotify api and started building the project based on that. 
</p>
<p>
    I am using spotify api to fetch the tracks related data. I have built a page which will search the tracks and fetch the data using spotify api 
    and display the data in correct format.
</p>
<p>
    I spent some time to incorporate the audio component of HTML5 to play the track searched by the user. But, looks like that ng-src attribute does
    not seem to work with audio component. It was not able to interpolate the data between {{}}. I found another component, ngAudio which can be used
    in this case. I will be working on this.
    Also, need to find out how to call a javascript method when the content loads so that data can be displayed in correct format.

<p>
    I will be dividing the projects and including the project related experiments also.
