This week, I did experiments using mongodb and nodejs. I got to learn about storing data in mongodb. <br />
First experiment --> Mongo DB - fetch data <br />
Second experiment --> Mongo DB - delete data <br />
Third experiment --> Mongo DB - add data<br />
Fourth experiment --> Mongo DB - update data<br />
Fifth experiment --> Mongo DB - view hierarchical data
<br />
Few experiments of mongoDB are working in local but on server giving some issue. I am working on resolving those.<br />
Apart from this, I have corrected the source code links for nodejs experiments. Also, I have made some changes in homepage. <br />
I realized that last few blog posts are showing that they are posted on a single day after I made a modification in them. I am finding out a way <br />
that they remain visible as per their original posted date.
