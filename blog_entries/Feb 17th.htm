This week, I got to learn about Ajax and Basic Angular JS. Idea for experiments is taken from Prof. Jose's lecture on 6th and 11th Feb.<br />
First experiment --> Fetching data from API using AJAX<br />
Second experiment --> Displaying data as per template using AJAX<br />
Third experiment --> Displaying multiple data rows as per template using AJAX<br />
Fourth experiment --> Basic Movie Database with delete using angular<br />
Fifth experiment --> Basic Movie Database with addition using angular<br />

I will be adding advance experiments using angular js next week.
