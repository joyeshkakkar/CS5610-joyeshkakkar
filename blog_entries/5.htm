This week, I got into Prof. Annunziato's class and got to learn responsive design using bootstrap.<br />
My experiments for this week are also depicting responsive design using bootstrap<br />
First experiment --> responsive text<br />
Second experiment --> responsive navigation bar<br />
Third experiment --> responsive layout<br />
Fourth experiment --> responsive table<br />
Fifth experiment --> responsive form<br />

I also categorized the experiments based on week and also made some changes to my homepage.
