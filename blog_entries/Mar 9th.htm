<p>
This week, I did experiments on nodejs. I got to learn about node js and setting up openshift server. <br />
First experiment --> Node js get <br />
Second experiment --> Node js delete <br />
Third experiment --> Node js post<br />
Fourth experiment --> Node js put<br />
Fifth experiment --> Node JS get for hierarchical data
<br />
Need to check why the source links are not working through openshift server.
