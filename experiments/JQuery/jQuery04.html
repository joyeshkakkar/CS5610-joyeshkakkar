                    Assassin's Creed is a historical fiction action-adventure open world stealth video game series. 
                    Assassin's Creed Unity is a 2014 historical fiction action-adventure open world stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released in November 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is the seventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag with ties to 2014's Assassin's Creed Rogue. Set within Paris during the French Revolution, the single-player story follows Arno Dorian in his efforts to expose the true powers behind the Revolution.
                    The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing a revamped combat, parkour and stealth system. The game also introduces cooperative multiplayer to the Assassin's Creed series, letting up to four players engage in narrative-driven missions and explore the open-world map.

            User can resize the text. Resize handles will be available in default values of "e", "s" and "se" which translates to right, bottom and bottom-right.
            Also, resizing will be happening according to grid size.
